# PinchAndDrag
SwiftUI Pinch (Zoom) and Drag Image

Adds an Instagram-like pinch-to-zoom and drag feature for images in SwiftUI. Removes the snap-back, spring feature so image will stay in place after zoom/being dragged.

1. Drag image into assets folder.
2. Replace "ImageName" with name of image.
3. Build!
